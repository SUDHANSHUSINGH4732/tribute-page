            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Subhash Chandra Bose, commonly known as Netaji, was a prominent leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. He was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha.

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Bose grew up in a well-to-do family and was deeply influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda. He went on to study at the University of Calcutta and later pursued his dream of joining the Indian Civil Services. However, he resigned from the prestigious post to actively participate in the freedom struggle.

            <h2>Role in Indian Freedom Movement</h2>
            <p>
                Subhash Chandra Bose was a key figure in the Indian National Congress and later became the President of the party. However, he disagreed with Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent approach and founded the Indian National Army (INA) to fight against British rule with the help of Axis powers during World War II.

                Netaji's charismatic leadership and unwavering determination inspired millions of Indians to strive for independence. His famous slogan, "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom," continues to resonate with people to this day.
